# Unnamed Game

A top-down 2D adventure RPG created in Python with Pygame & PyTMX.

This game attempts to recreate the overall feeling provided by older RPGMaker games. It includes a number of features 
which aren't typically seen in the genre, but still remains true to the experience. For example: line of sight 
exploration, seamless area transitions, additional item interactibility, and more.


## Default Controls

Arrow keys: navigate,

Z: select / interact,

X: cancel / menu
