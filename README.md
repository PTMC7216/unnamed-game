# Unnamed Game

A top-down 2D adventure RPG game created in Python with Pygame & PyTMX.

Heavily inspired by older RPGMaker games, this game attempts to replicate the overall feeling they provided
while also introducing a number of unique features, such as: line of sight exploration, seamless area transitions,
deeper item interactibility, and more.


## Default Controls

Arrow keys: navigate,

Z: select / interact,

X: cancel / menu
